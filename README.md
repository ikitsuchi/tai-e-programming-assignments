## Tai-e Assignments for Static Program Analysis
</div>

### Overview

> Tai-e is an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use program analysis framework for real-world Java programs. On top of Tai-e, eight programming assignments are designed to cover different program analysis topics introduced in the lectures of Static Program Analysis. ([Overview of Tai-e Assignments](https://tai-e.pascal-lab.net/en/intro/overview.html))

Here is my implementation of the Tai-e framework, the online course Static Program Analysis programming assignment. I made this repository public to help guys struggling with assignments get some inspiration when they are at their wits' end, as resources about this course are so scarce on the internet. But remember, **BE HONEST, DO NOT PLAGIARIZE**.
